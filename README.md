# recycling-scraper: Scraping the materials-list off of Boston.gov's recycling page


### "Preview"

This project was made using BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium. I would've only used BeautifulSoup but I encountered a few issues while parsing the HTML source. More specifically, some <div> tags were missing attributes and children that I was trying to access. This was my first time scraping. I used some YouTube tutorials (Thanks Tech With Tim!) to get started on some of BeautifulSoup's syntax and then a lot of StackExchange to figure out Selenium

### Pre-Requisites

I used the following specs to make and run this project:

Python 3.11.4


(that's it)
